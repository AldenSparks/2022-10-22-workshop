# Beginner Coding Workshop

This workshop is for beginners with no web development experience to have a chance to give coding a try with in-person help from coaches! It will be in OKC on Saturday, October 22, 2022. We'll start at 1:00 pm and go until 5:00 pm. The exact location will be shared with accepted applicants. This event is free to attendees because of our sponsors!

## Sponsors

We’re looking for [sponsors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l3QvZ0DInVqpiKFsdw4L3ZinT-J4m_wL6JDDRx0uv44/) to cover the costs for this beginner-level coding workshop so that it’s free for community members to attend.

For sponsorship questions and sales, or to request an in-kind or other custom sponsorship package, contact the workshop facilitator Kimberly Collins (kcollins at techlahoma.org).
